### Routing

<!-- .slide: data-background="img/background-green-orig.jpg" -->

- <b>Hash based routing</b>
- <b>HTML5 routing</b>

Three main components that we use to configure routing: 
- <b>Routes</b>
- <b>RouterOutlet</b>
- <b>RouterLink</b>

Note:
With client-side routing we’re not necessarily making a request to the server on every URL change. With our Angular apps,
we refer to them as “Single Page Apps” (SPA) because our server only gives us a single page and it’s our JavaScript that renders the different pages. 

Defining routes in our application is useful because we can: 
- separate different areas of the app; 
- maintain the state in the app;
 - protect areas of the app based on certain rules;
